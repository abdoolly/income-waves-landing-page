    question: 'How quickly do I see returns?',
    answer: `Here's exactly when you'll see your money coming back:
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Month 1:</strong> You invest your money (e.g., $500)
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Month 2-3:</strong> You start getting monthly updates showing how the products are selling and how much profit you're making
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Month 3-4:</strong> You get your first cash payout - your share of the profits from sales
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Month 4-7:</strong> You get your original $500 back PLUS all the profits you've earned
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Example:</strong> Invest $500 → Get back $650-$675 in 4-6 months
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Compare this to:</strong> Putting $500 in stocks might take years to earn $150-$175, and savings accounts earn almost nothing.`,

    question: 'How is inventory verified?',
    answer: `Amazon's FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) system provides independent, third-party verification of all inventory. When sellers ship products to Amazon warehouses, each item is scanned, counted, and verified by Amazon's logistics team before being marked as "received" in the seller's account.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Here's exactly what happens:</strong>
            <br />• Sellers ship inventory to Amazon FBA warehouses with tracking numbers
            <br />• Amazon physically receives, inspects, and counts every unit
            <br />• Only after Amazon confirms receipt do we release funds to the seller
            <br /><br />
            This creates a secure, transparent process where a neutral third party (Amazon) confirms your investment is backing real, verified inventory before any money changes hands.
            <strong>
              No inventory confirmation = no fund release, keeping your investment protected.<i class="fa-solid fa-shield-alt"></i>
            </strong>`,
